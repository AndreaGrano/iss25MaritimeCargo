  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p> 
    A Maritime Cargo shipping company intends to automate the operations of load of 
    freight in the ship’s cargo hold. To this end, the company plans to employ a 
    Differential Drive Robot for the loading of goods in the ship's hold.

  <h3>2.2 Requirements clarifications from the customer</h3>
  <p>After a conversation with the customer, he clarified the meaning of <a href="../../../sprint0/userDocs/DeSimoni-Grano-LoBuglio_sprint0_v2.html#RF11">RF11</a>.
    In particular he highlighted that <b>every single functionality of the system</b>, including the movement of <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span>, <b>must be stopped</b> when <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> measures a distance D &gt; DFREE for at least 3 secs.</p>

  <h2>3. Problem analysis</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Normal procedure for handling of load requests</h3>
  <blockquote>Question: what is the workflow when a loadRequest is submitted by a client?</blockquote>
  <p>
    The following steps describe the typical sequence of actions that occur when a 
    <span class="keyword">loadRequest</span> is received for a product to be placed in the ship’s hold:
    <ol>
      <li>
        A <span class="keyword">loadRequest</span> is issued to the 
        <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> for a specific product to be stored in the ship's hold.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> verifies with the 
        <span class="keyword">productservice</span> whether the product has been registered.<br>
        NB: Registration of a product does not imply that a load request must be issued. 
        It is possible that no load request will ever be created for a registered product.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the product is registered, it requests an available slot to be assigned.
      </li>
      <li>
        When <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> detects that a new product has arrived at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span>, 
        i.e. when the sensor measures a distance D &lt; DFREE/2 for a reasonable duration (i.e., 3 seconds),
        it signals it to <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span>.
      </li>
      <li id="cargorobot-steps">
        Once detected, <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> sends to the <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> the slot where to put the container.
        Starting from its HOME position, <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> picks up the product at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span>, delivers it to the assigned slot, 
        unloads it, and returns to HOME.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>N.B: Any new load request received during the above steps are queued and processed only after the robot has returned to its HOME position.</b>
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Special cases for load requests</h3>
  <p>
    While the standard procedure ensures smooth product placement in the hold, 
    several exceptional scenarios must be considered to guarantee system robustness, 
    reliability, and safety. 
    The following sections outlines the key exceptions that may occur during the handling of a <span class="keyword">loadRequest</span>, 
    along with the expected system behavior in each case.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>Problem: what happens when a loadRequest is submitted for an <b>unregistered product</b>?</blockquote>
  <p>If a product is unregistered, the system cannot know its weight and assess whether the load is acceptable in order not to overload the hold.
    For this reason, in this case a loadRequest must be <span style="color:red">rejected</span>.</p>

  <blockquote>Problem: what happens when a loadRequest is submitted, but there is <b>no available slot</b>?</blockquote>
  <p>The hold is obviously finite and has only so many spot where products can be loaded (in this case, 4). 
    If a product is eligible for loading, but there isn't any available slot, a loadRequest must be <span style="color:red">rejected</span>.<br>
    One may propose a system to optimize loading requests in some way (e.g. priority), but it is totally outside of the requirements and nothing will be done in this way.</p>

  <blockquote>Problem: what happens when there is a failure regarding sonar sensor?</blockquote>
  <p>As enforced by the customer, when a failure for sonar sensor is detected (anther the condition in <a href="../../../sprint0/userDocs/DeSimoni-Grano-LoBuglio_sprint0_v2.html#RF11">RF11</a>), 
    every functionality of the system must be stopped. In this sense, the system needs to not allow any submission of load requests; therefore, when a failure is detected and until it is solved, 
    any new loadRequest must be <span style="color:red">rejected</span>.</p>

  <h3>3.3 cargorobot behavior during a sonar sensor failure</h3>
  <blockquote>Problem: what happens to <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> when a <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> failure is detected?</blockquote>
  <p>As enforced by the customer, when a <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> failure is detected the system must stop any of his activities.
    In this sense, he heavily stressed that even cargorobot must interrupt any of his movement.</p>

  <h3>3.4 A small sub-system deployed far away</h3>
  <p>
    The aim of this sprint is to the develop a small sub-system that reads and eventually evaluates distances measured with a <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span>.
    Since it is deployed at the ioport, this node has to be small and efficient. Also, our software house has already developed some usefull <span class="keyword-other">python scripts</span> that can be usefull in order interface the system with the physical devices at the ioport (i.e. sonar and LED); 
    those scripts can be found <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/tree/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python">here</a> and are, in particular:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a hfref="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python/sonar.py">sonar.py</a>: a script that read a distance using a sonar connected to a RaspberryPi and writes the data in a text file
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python/ledPython25On.py">ledPython25On</a> and 
        <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python/ledPython25Off.py">ledPython25Off</a>: 
         two scripts that turns on and off, respectively, a LED connected to a RaspberryPi.
      </li>
    </ul>
    For those reasons, we chose to adopt a <span class="keyword">RaspberryPi</span>, a small <span class="keyword-other">single-board computer (SBC)</span> that is optimal to the ends of this sub-system. 
    It should be noted that the softwares developed by our software house should be compatible with every iteration of this SBC, but they have been largly tested with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</a>.

    <div class="image-container">
      <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/"><img width="90%" alt="RaspberryPi" title="RaspberryPi" src="./img/RaspberryPi.jpg"></a>
    <div class="caption">Figure 2 – RaspberryPi</div>
    </div>
  </p>

  <h3>3.4.1 Sonar sensor</h3>
  <p>In order to interface the system the python script that act as a sort of driver for <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span>, abstracting from its physical implementation, 
    we need a new software component that sends the distances that has been read to every other component who is interested in them. 
    For this purpose, we are introducing a new actor, named <span class="keyword">dbwrapper</span>.</p>

  <blockquote>Question: who does evaluate the distances measured by <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span>?</blockquote>
  <p>
    The distances measured by the <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> are significant for two different scopes:
    <ul>
      <li>acknowledging the presence of a new product at the ioport (i.e. when a value D &lt; DFREE/2 is measuered for at least 3 secs)</li>
      <li>evaluating if the sonar sensor has failed (i.e. when a value D &gt; DFREE is measuered for at least 3 secs)</li>
    </ul>
    In order to satisfy those requirements we need two different new software components (one responsability each). 
    We chose to model them as actors, since they have to autonomously interact with other entities of the system in an reactive/active manner (they will receive data from <span class="keyword">sonarwrapper</span> and send signals according to their roles); they are:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="keyword">containerManager</span>, an Actor that receives data from <span class="keyword">sonarwrapper</span>, evaluates if a new product container is present at the ioport and eventually signals it to <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span></li>
      <li><span class="keyword">alarmManager</span>, an Actor that receives data from <span class="keyword">sonarwrapper</span>, evaluates if <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> has failed and eventually signals this event to the other entities; also, it signals when the system can resume its acrivities after a previous failure has been solved</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <blockquote>Question: who does turn on and off the LED?</blockquote>
  <p>An immediate choise would be to let <span>alarmManager</span> to turn on and off the LED, according to his evaluation of data. However, maybe it is better to delegate this operation to another software component, either an existing or a newly introduced one, since it seems a very specific behavior (in order to signal a failure) that could be changed in the future. 
    In this sense, <span class="keyword">alarmManager</span> would remain the same and only the other entity should be changed accordingly. </p>
  
  <h3>3.5 Logical architecture</h3>
  <p>After the problem analysis the following is the logical architecture.</p>
  <div class="image-container">

  </div>

  <a href="../src/logArch.qak">Qak model</a> of the logical architecture.


  <h2>4. Project</h2>
  <p>
    We think it's better for this sprint realization to divide implementation into the following parts:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#part-1">Part 1</a>: sonar sensor implementation</li>
      <li><a href="#part-2">Part 2</a>: delivering operation</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3 id="part-1">4.1 Part 1: sonar sensor implementation</h3>
  <p>
    As stated during the problem analysis phase, in order to interface with the data produced by <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span>, the system requires a set of 
    specialized software components, each responsible for a distinct aspect of interaction and control. <br>
    These entities collectively ensure correct detection of container presence at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span> and 
    <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> fault monitoring. <br>
    So, we implemented the following Actors:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">sonarWrapper</span>: 
        this is an actor which reads distances from a text file produced by the script <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python/sonar.py">sonar.py</a>, 
        in order to remain <span class="keyword-other">hardware-agnostic</span>.
        It performs periodic sampling of the measured distance, once every second, and emits <span class="keyword-other">distance update events</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">containerManager</span>: 
        this is an actor that collects distance events emitted by <span class="keyword">sonarWrapper</span> and evaluates whether a product container is present at the ioport (i.e. when a distance D &lt; DFREE/2 has been measuered for at least 3 secs).
        If so, it sends a containerwaiting request to <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> and waits for the correspondent reply
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">alarmManager</span>: 
        this is an actor that collects distance events emitted by <span class="keyword">sonarWrapper</span> and evaluates whether the <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> has failed (i.e. when a distance D &gt; DFREE has been measuered for at least 3 secs).
        If so, it emits a <span class="keyword-other">stop interrupt event</span>; when the failure has been solved it also emits a <span class="keyword-other">resume</span> event
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="keyword">alarmDevice</span>:
        this is an actor that collects stop and resume events emitted by alarmManager and turn on and off a LED accordingly, using the 
        <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python/ledPython25On.py">ledPython25On</a> and 
        <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python/ledPython25Off.py">ledPython25Off</a> 
        python scripts already developed by our software house
      </li>
    </ul><br>
  </p>

  <h3 id="part-2">4.2 Part 2: delivering operation</h3>
  In this sprint, the focus shifts to implementing the delivery workflow for the <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span>, which is responsible for transporting 
  a container from the <span class="keyword">ioport</span> to an assigned slot. <br>
  The pathfinding and map management logic was already completed in <a href="../../../sprint1/userDocs/DeSimoni-Grano-LoBuglio_sprint1_v1.html#part-1">sprint1</a>.
  The software implementation follows what specified in <a href="#cargorobot-steps">point 5 of paragraph 3.1</a>.

  <h3>4.3 Physical implementation</h3>
  For the physical implementation of the sonar we used a <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf"><span class="keyword-other">HC-SR04</span> sonar sensor</a>.
  <div class="image-container">
    <img width="90%" alt="HC-SR04" title="HC-SR04" src="./img/HC-SR04.webp">  
    <div class="caption">Figure 3 – Sensor HC-SR04</div>
  </div> <br>
  We connected it to a RaspberryPi GPIO and it is controlled by the means of the Python script <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python/sonar.py">sonar.py</a>.
  We also connected the LED to the Raspberry Pi GPIO.<br>

  <h2>6. Conclusions</h2>
  During this sprint, we successfully completed the implementation of all functionalities related to the <span class="keyword">ioport</span> 
  management and the container delivery process to the assigned slots.
  Specifically, the following objectives were achieved:
  <ul>
    <li>realization of dedicated components to read and analize data produced by the <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span>
      (<span class="keyword">sonarWrapper</span>, <span class="keyword">containerManager</span>, and <span class="keyword">alarmDevice</span>).</li>
    <li>accurate detection of product presence at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span> and real-time handling 
      of system failure conditions triggered by <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> anomalies.</li>
    <li>implementation of the <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> logic for performing automated container pickup and delivery, 
      including movement from HOME to <span class="keyword">ioport</span>, delivery to the assigned slot, 
      unloading, and returning to HOME.</li>
  </ul>
  In addition, we developed and verified all mechanisms for system suspension and resume based on <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> 
  input, ensuring compliance with safety requirements (<a href="../../../sprint0/userDocs/DeSimoni-Grano-LoBuglio_sprint0_v1.html#rf11">RF11</a> and
  <a href="../../../sprint0/userDocs/DeSimoni-Grano-LoBuglio_sprint0_v1.html#rf12">RF12</a>). <br>
  All components were fully tested, both individually and as part of end-to-end system flows, 
  and the sprint goals were completed within the planned timeframe.<br>
  This sprint represents a significant milestone toward a fully autonomous and sensor-driven cargo handling system.<br>
  This sprint laid the foundation for the next development phase, which is:
