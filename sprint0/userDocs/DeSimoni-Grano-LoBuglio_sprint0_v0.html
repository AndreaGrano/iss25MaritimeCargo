  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p> 
    A Maritime Cargo shipping company intends to automate the operations of load of 
    freight in the ship’s cargo hold. To this end, the company plans to employ a 
    Differential Drive Robot for the loading of goods in the ship's hold.
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 Our motto</h3>
  <p>
    <blockquote>There is no code without a project, 
    there is no project without problem analysis, 
    there is no problem without <b><u>requirements</u></b>.</blockquote>
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Aims of sprint0</h3>
  <p>
    The aims of the current sprint are:
    <ul>
      <li>Formalization of the requirements analysis given by the customer, in order to make them machine-understandable</li>
      <li>Agreement on the meanings of the requirements from both parties</li>
      <li>Drafting of a general model of the system</li>
      <li>Drafting of a primitive interaction schema</li>
      <li>Design of executable test plans to show the customer the main behaviour of the system</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>1.3 Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    A primary interaction with the customer pointed out the following requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>The products must be registered in a database by specifying its weight using a proper service (<span class="keyword">productservice</span>)</li>
      <li>At the end of the registration process, productservice returns a positive integer <b>Unique Product Identifier</b> <span class="keyword">PID</span></li>
      <li>The hold is a rectangular, flat area with an Input/Output port (<span class="keyword">ioport</span>)</li>
      <li>There are <span class="keyword">4 slots</span> provided for storage</li>
      <li>There is an additional slot, but it's permanently occupied, so it acts like an obstacle (<span class="keyword">slot5</span>)</li>
      <li>When the product is registered, a load request can be sent. The outcome is postive if the weight is under a certain threshold (<span class="keyword">MAX_WEIGHT</span>) and if there is still at least 1 slot available</li>
      <li>If and when the load request is accepted, <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> associates a slot to the product <span class="keyword">PID</span> and returns the name of the reserved slot</li>
      <li>After the association, <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> waits for the product to be delivered at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span>. In the meantime, other requests will not be elaborated</li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> is able to detect (by means of the <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span>) the presence of the product container at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span> when a distance less than <span class="keyword">DFREE/2</span> is measured for a reasonable time (e.g. 3s)</li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> is able to ensure that the product container is placed by the <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> within its reserved slot</li>
      <li>After placing the load in the reserved spot, <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> should return to its <span class="keyword">HOME</span> location, then <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> can start processing another load-request</li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> is able to show the current state of the hold, by mesans of a dynamically updated <span class="keyword">web-gui</span>.</li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> interrupts any activity and turns on a LED if the sonar sensor measures a distance <span class="keyword">D > DFREE</span> for at least 3s. The service continues its activities as soon as the sonar measures a distance <span class="keyword">D &le; DFREE</span></li>
    </ul>

  <h3>2.3 General overview</h3>
  <h4>2.3.1 Software provided by the customer</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/tree/main/unibo.basicrobot24">BasicRobot</a> - software component which executes movement commands of a DDR-robot, 
      regardless of the technology with which the robot is implemented (virtual or real)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/tree/main/sonarLed2025/resources/python">RaspberryPi utility software</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/tree/8789bc1ec22bed8ce3cda499ef08cc77840cc900/sonarLed2025">SonarLed2025</a> 
      - a software already implemented and usable which
      allows to get the distance from the sonar and to blink a LED
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2.3.2 Bounded contexts</h4>
  From the analysis of text provided by the customer we found out
  that the software system is going to comprehend 5 boundend contexts 
  at least:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Loading management/Cargo process</b> -
      this context is a mastermind that interacts with other contexts in 
      order to manage requests by checking the weight, assigning product's 
      PID to a slot if available, detecting if there is a container at the 
      IO port and delivers it to the assigned slot;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Hold inventory / slot management</b> -
      this context manages slots knowing which ones are available or occupied.
      It also knows the products' PIDs associated with occupied slots;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Physical IO / robot/sensor gateway</b> -
      this context interacts with sonar detecting if a container is available at the IO port;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Hold visualization / reporting</b> -
      this context provides data and manages the GUI in order to show the state of the hold dinamically;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Product management</b> -
      this context manages products' lifecycle and it provides registration service, it 
      associates a given product with a PID and stores product's details
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Model</h2>
  <h3>4.1 Why QAK</h3>
  We chose to model the system with the <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/iss25Material/docs/_build/html/QakActors25Linguaggio.html">QAK</a> meta-modelling language since we want to follow the microservice and actors paradigms and this
  DSL (Domain Specific Language) has been developed in order to fill the abstraction gap related to communication between those entities.
  We also chose QAK for these reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>It was entirely implemented by our software house, which makes it easier to get information and support from the actual creator of the language.</li>
    <li>It provides a way to represent concepts related to services, such as request, response, dispatch, etc., while other general-purpose languages would need external libraries (e.g. Java would need some kind of JAR to implement Actors), frameworks or resources to do the same.</li>
    <li>It allows you to create executable models directly from the language, which capture the salient aspects of the requirements or problems.</li>
    <li>Our software house already has some project and components we could exploit and use.</li>
    <li>It's easy to create prototipes to show to the customer</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Test plans</h2>
  <h3>5.1 Interaction: Alien → cargoService</h3>
  To verify the interaction between Alien and cargoservice 
  we realized the following test. As Alien entity we used testCargo.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Product exists and does NOT weigh too much</b>, therefore the load request is <b style="color:green">accepted</b>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Product does NOT exist</b>, therefore the load request is <b style="color:red">rejected</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Product weighs too much</b> and if we add it to the hold we are exceeding hold's MAX_WEIGHT, therefore the load request is <b style="color:red">rejected</b>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>7. Sprint conclusions</h2>

  <h3>7.1 Summary</h3>
  This first Sprint (Sprint0) grouped the requirements of the project, by outlining the following macro components, ordered by priority:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Core-business (requirements 
        <a href="#rf1">RF1</a>, <a href="#rf2">RF2</a>, <a href="#rf3">RF3</a>, <a href="#rf4">RF4</a>): 
        involves the chain of the main nodes of the system.<br>
      <b style="color: red;">HIGH PRIORITY</b>: the service can't be provided without it.
    </li>
    <li>ioport
      (requirements <a href="#rf5">RF5</a>, <a href="#rf6">RF6</a>, <a href="#rf7">RF7</a>, <a href="#rf8">RF8</a>):
        involves the delivery of products to the right reserved slot.<br>
      <b style="color: orange;">MEDIUM PRIORITY</b>: the service can receive requests but can't take the product to the reserved slot without it.
    </li>
    <li>GUI (requirement <a href="#rf10">RF10</a>): shows the current state of the hold<br>
      <b style="color: green;">LOW PRIORITY</b>: the system correctly works, this is an "additional service".</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>7.2 Open issues</h3>
  During the Sprint0 we found out the following open issues to ask to the customer:
  <ul>
    <li>Alien: which entity gives the input for product creation, deletion and load?</li>
    <li>
      Request queue: when a load request arrives when the system is stopped for sensor failure, which policy we should use:
      <ul>
        <li>The request is processed immediately and rejected. The requester must resubmit the load request.</li>
        <li>The request is queued and processed once the system becomes available again.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7.3 Workplan</h3>
  We decided to partition the system into 3 main sprints, which follows the macro components mentioned above.
  <ol>
    <li><b>Sprint1 - core-business</b>: cargoService, productService, cargorobot, holdManager, dbWrapper</li>
    <li><b>Sprint2 - ioport</b>: sonarWrapper, alarmDevice, interaction with the core business</li>
    <li><b>Sprint3 - GUI</b>: holdManagerGUI</li>
  </ol>

  The workplan outlined herein is indicative and may be subject to change.
  The team will make every reasonable effort to adhere to the planned schedule and activities as closely as possible.
  Any significant variations or adjustments to the workplan will be communicated in due course as the project progresses.
