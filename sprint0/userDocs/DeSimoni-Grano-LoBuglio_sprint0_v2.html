  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p> 
    A Maritime Cargo shipping company intends to automate the operations of load of 
    freight in the ship’s cargo hold. To this end, the company plans to employ a 
    Differential Drive Robot for the loading of goods in the ship's hold.
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 Our motto</h3>
  <p>
    <blockquote>There is no code without a project, 
    there is no project without problem analysis, 
    there is no problem without <b><u>requirements</u></b>.</blockquote>
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Aims of sprint0</h3>
  <p>
    The aims of the current sprint are:
    <ul>
      <li>Formalization of the requirements analysis given by the customer, in order to make them machine-understandable</li>
      <li>Agreement on the meanings of the requirements from both parties</li>
      <li>Drafting of a general model of the system</li>
      <li>Drafting of a primitive interaction schema</li>
      <li>Design of executable test plans to show the customer the main behaviour of the system</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>1.3 Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    The requirements given by the customer can be found <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/iss25Material/docs/_build/html/TemaFinale25.html#tf2025-requirements">here</a>.<br>
    We report them here:
    <ul>
      <li>To be loaded into the hold, the products must be registered in a database by specifying its weight using a proper service (<span class="keyword">productservice</span>)</li>
      <li>At the end of the registration process, productservice returns a positive integer <b>Unique Product Identifier</b> <span class="keyword">PID</span></li>
      <li>The hold is a rectangular, flat area with an Input/Output port (<span class="keyword">ioport</span>)</li>
      <li>There are <span class="keyword">4 slots</span> provided for storage</li>
      <li>There is an additional slot, but it's permanently occupied, so it acts like an obstacle (<span class="keyword">slot5</span>)</li>
      <li>When the product is registered, a load request can be sent. If the weight is under a certain threshold (<span class="keyword">MAX_WEIGHT</span>) and if there is still at least 1 slot available, the request is accepted</li>
      <li>If and when the load request is accepted, <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> associates a slot to the product's <span class="keyword">PID</span> and returns the name of the reserved slot</li>
      <li>After the association, <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> waits for the product to be delivered at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span>. In the meantime, other requests will not be elaborated</li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> is able to detect (by means of the <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span>) the presence of the product container at the <span class="keyword">ioport</span> when a distance less than <span class="keyword">DFREE/2</span> is measured for a reasonable time (e.g. 3s)</li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> is able to ensure that the product container is placed by the <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> within its reserved slot</li>
      <li>After placing the load in the reserved slot, <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> should return to its <span class="keyword">HOME</span> location, then <span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> can start processing another load request</li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> is able to show the current state of the hold, by means of a dynamically updated <span class="keyword">web-gui</span></li>
      <li><span class="keyword">cargoservice</span> interrupts any activity and turns on a LED if the <span class="keyword">sonar</span> sensor measures a distance <span class="keyword">D > DFREE</span> for at least 3s. The service continues its activities as soon as the <span class="keyword">sonar</span> measures a distance <span class="keyword">D &le; DFREE</span></li>

  <h2>3. Requirements formalization</h2>
  The approach adopted in this section may indeed lend itself to certain ambiguities due to the use of language 
  that is not machine-interpretable. However, we consider this choice valuable, as it enables readers of the documentation 
  to fully understand the model derived from the customer's requirements. All elements described here will subsequently be 
  formalized in QAK (the reasons for which are detailed in the following paragraph), ensuring that any potential ambiguities 
  arising from natural language will be resolved.

  <h3>3.1 Why QAK</h3>
  We chose to model the system with the <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2025/blob/main/iss25Material/docs/_build/html/QakActors25Linguaggio.html">QAK</a> meta-modelling language since the problem requires to follow the microservice and actors paradigms and this
  DSL (Domain Specific Language) has been developed in order to fill the abstraction gap related to communication between those entities.
  We also chose QAK for these reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>It was entirely implemented by our software house, which makes it easier to get information and support from the actual creator of the language</li>
    <li>It provides a way to represent concepts related to services, such as request, response, dispatch, etc., while other general-purpose languages would need external libraries (e.g. Java would need some kind of JAR to implement Actors), frameworks or resources to do the same</li>
    <li>It allows you to create executable models directly from the language, which capture the salient aspects of the requirements or problems</li>
    <li>Our software house already has some project and components we could exploit and use</li>
    <li>It's easy to create prototipes to show to the customer</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Entities</h3>
  As in all complex software systems, we will decompose the overall system into high-level 
  software macro-components, which will be progressively listed and formalized. The categories of components that 
  can be defined are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>POJO</b></li>
    <li><b>Actors</b>: In the context of the QAK language, 
      Actors are autonomous entities that encapsulate state and behavior, 
      communicate with each others, and can react to events or messages 
      in a concurrent and decoupled manner. Each Actor processes incoming messages sequentially, 
      enabling safe concurrent execution within the system. <br>
      Sometimes, the terms Actor and Service are used interchangeably. 
      The distinction is that an Actor interacting with remote entities is typically referred to as a Service, 
      while an Actor managing only local entities is simply an Actor.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <table id="entities">
    <tr>
      <th>Entity</th>
      <th>Activity</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description/Behaviour</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="keyword">productService</span></td>
      <td>Reactive & proactive</td>
      <td>Service</td>
      <td>
        Actor that receives and handles products creation and deletion requests.
        It associates a PID to a product.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="keyword">cargoService</span></td>
      <td>Reactive & proactive</td>
      <td>Service</td>
      <td>The mind of the system: it handles requests to <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span> and consults, updates and manages 
        the product database and <span class="keyword">cargorobot</span>. It also sends updates to the <span class="keyword">web-gui</span>. 
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="keyword">cargorobot</span></td>
      <td>Reactive</td>
      <td>Actor</td>
      <td>The main entity of the maritime cargo system, which moves within the hold area and 
          performs product delivery to a slot when <span class="keyword">sonar sensor</span> detects its arrival at the <span class="keyword">ioport.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="keyword">web-gui</span></td>
      <td>Reactive</td>
      <td>Actor</td>
      <td>Entity that receives data from the <span class="keyword">cargoService</span> and updates a web-GUI, used to monitor the status of the hold. 
        We model it as an actor beacuse it processes messages one by one and updates the web-GUI accordingly. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="keyword">testCargo</span></td>
      <td>Proactive</td>
      <td>(Test)<br>Actor</td>
      <td>Test actor that sends dummy requests to the <span class="keyword">cargoService</span>  in order to verify how the whole system reacts.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>3.3 Data</h3>
  We had chosen <span class="keyword">Kotlin</span> because it provides the built-in syntax necessary to declare our model elements 
  and can be included in QAK code.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Product exists, it does not weigh too much and there is a free slot</b>, therefore the load request is <b style="color:green">accepted</b>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Product does NOT exist</b>, therefore the load request is <b style="color:red">rejected</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Product weighs too much</b> and if we add it to the hold we are exceeding hold's MAX_WEIGHT, therefore the load request is <b style="color:red">rejected</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Product exists, it does not weigh too much</b>, but all slots are occupied, therefore the load request is <b style="color:red">rejected</b>.</li>

  <h2>7. Sprint conclusions</h2>

  <h3>7.1 Summary</h3>
  This first Sprint (Sprint0) grouped the requirements of the project, by outlining the following macro components, ordered by priority:
  <ol>
    <li id="core-business">
      Core-business (requirements 
        <a href="#rf1">RF1</a>, <a href="#rf2">RF2</a>, <a href="#rf3">RF3</a>, <a href="#rf4">RF4</a>, <a href="#rf7">RF7</a>, <a href="#rf8">RF8</a>, <a href="#rf9">RF9</a>,
        <a href="#rf13">RF13</a>, <a href="#rf14">RF14</a>, <a href="#rf15">RF15</a>, <a href="#rf16">RF16</a>, <a href="#rf17">RF17</a>): 
        involves the chain of the main nodes of the system.<br>
      <b style="color: red;">HIGH PRIORITY</b>: the service can't be provided without it.
    </li>
    <li id="ioport">ioport
      (requirements <a href="#rf5">RF5</a>, <a href="#rf6">RF6</a>, <a href="#rf11">RF11</a>, <a href="#rf12">RF12</a>):
        involves the delivery of products to the right reserved slot.<br>
      <b style="color: orange;">MEDIUM PRIORITY</b>: the service can receive requests but can't take the product to the reserved slot without it.
    </li>
    <li id="web-gui">GUI (requirement <a href="#rf10">RF10</a>): shows the current state of the hold<br>
      <b style="color: green;">LOW PRIORITY</b>: the system correctly works, this is an "additional service".</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>7.2 Open issues</h3>
  During the Sprint0 we found out the following open issues to ask to the customer:
  <ul>
    <li>Alien: which entity gives the input for product creation, deletion and load?</li>
    <li>
      Request queue: when a load request arrives when the system is stopped for sensor failure, which policy we should use:
      <ul>
        <li>The request is processed immediately and rejected. The requester must resubmit the load request.</li>
        <li>The request is queued and processed once the system becomes available again.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7.3 Workplan</h3>
  We decided to partition the system into 3 main sprints, which follows the macro components mentioned above.
